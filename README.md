# Whack-A-Mole

### In this game, when the timer begins, "moles" will appear on the screen and the player will need to click on them aka WHACK them for points! But this isn't your typical Whack-A-Mole.. I felt bad whacking a poor little mole, so we get to whack some potatoes! 

 ### According to our beloved Wikipedia, Whac-A-Mole was an arcade game, originally known as Mogura Taiji or Mogura Tataki in Japan. In 1978, it debuted at a midway exhibition show, where it was the most popular game. The following year, it debuted at pinball parlours. In 1980, it was sold in the carnival, amusement park and coin-op arcade markets. Whac-A-Mole has since become a popular carnival game. 

### But now in 2022, you can play it on the internet!
